It takes more than good ideas, technology, and skilled individuals to build long-term success. 

Do you recognize any of the following?

* It takes too long to release new features.
* Quality issues are discovered late – sometimes by customers.
* Bugs dominate the backlog and take up the team's time.
* Customer satisfaction is low, churn is high.
* The team feels tired, divided, or frustrated.
* People leave – or carry the entire delivery on their shoulders.
* Technology investments are not delivering the results you hoped for.

Then it may be time to pause and review how you work.

As an advisor and coach, I help you see what is actually happening in everyday work – and why things look the way they do. Together, we identify areas for improvement, link them to your goals, and lay the foundation for a more effective and sustainable way of working.

### Let's have an initial conversation

We start with a current state analysis: a few conversations, an overview of architecture, tech stack, and how the team works. This leads to a summary of insights and recommendations linked to your goals.
