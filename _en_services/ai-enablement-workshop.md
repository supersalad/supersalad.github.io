## Accelerate development processes with AI tools

Can AI tools and agents really deliver on the promise of increased productivity for developers? As with most things that are complex – it depends.

What we see is that it takes an effort to learn how to use AI tools in the right way – and just as importantly, to know **when** they should be used. As with any new skill, you need to set aside time to explore the possibilities of the tools and test them in your own context.

The workshop is preceded by a pre-study where we look at your current challenges and identify areas where AI tools can provide concrete value. Examples of suitable challenges:

* Upgrading frameworks (e.g. from .NET Framework to .NET Core)  
* Introducing a new architectural pattern  
* Expanded test automation

We reserve three consecutive days in your calendar to jointly learn, explore, and try out use cases and working methods with relevant AI tools and technologies.

During the following 3–6 months, we schedule a couple of follow-ups.

The goal is for you to leave with both concrete patterns for continued work, and insights into **how and when** you best integrate AI tools into your software development process.

A suitable number of participants is 3-8 people.
