# Legacy, new development and everything in between

Do you need to strengthen a team or bring in an experienced developer for a specific assignment? I am happy to join as a senior system developer, lead developer, or architect depending on the needs of your team or project.

I have extensive experience in both building new systems and maintaining existing ones that have become difficult to change. Whether the goal is to renew, simplify, or just get things working as intended, I help create stable solutions that can be further developed â€“ without losing speed or quality along the way.

I would like to highlight two challenges that are easy to overlook:

### Are we building the right thing?
Modern system development is very much about creating and continuously adjusting feedback loops that validate that the market/customers/users get what they want and can solve their problem in a better way than before. To optimize this part, technical investments are needed. But also culture and processes that pull in the right direction. I love to contribute with my experience in this area.

### Are we building it the right way?
A well-adapted architecture, visible and managed technical debt, and automation over manual intervention are some of the prerequisites for building long-term success with a digital service. There are technical capabilities that must be continously sharpened to get to a codebase and development environment where the team can deliver with confidence, speed, and quality over time. I am happy to help identify improvements, prioritise to get the most bang for the buck, and implement changes.


### Technical profile

#### My main expertise:
* .NET / C#
* AI-assisted development (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, CodeRabbit etc.)
* Azure (App Services, Functions, Storage, DevOps etc.)
* CI/CD and automated testing
* System architecture and technical design
* Integrations and APIs
* Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
* Modernization and refactoring of legacy
* Infrastructure as code (e.g. Bicep, Terraform)
* Docker

#### I am also comfortable with:
* React / Next.js
* Node.js
* Python
* Jekyll
* Kubernetes
* And much more (read more in my [CV](/assets/docs/Andreas_Folkesson_CV_en_250723.pdf))
