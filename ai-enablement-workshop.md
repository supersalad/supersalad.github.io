# Accelerate development processes with AI tools

Can AI tools and agents deliver on their promises to increase development productivity? As with most things that are complicated - it depends.
What we can see is that learning how to use, and equally important when to use AI tools is an effort. As with all new skills it is necessary to set aside the time to explore the capabilities of the tools and apply it in your own context.

This workshop is preceeded with scoping where we look into challenges you are currently facing, and where AI tools may be a good fit to provide value.
Example of suitable challenges are:
 * Framework upgrade (e.g. .Net Framework -> .Net Core)
 * Applying new architectural pattern
 * Test automation and extended test coverage

We carve out 3 consecutive days in your calendar where we learn and explore use cases and ways of working with relevant AI tools and techniques.

In the following period (3-6 months) we schedule a couple of follow ups.

The expected outcomes for you are both patterns to continue the work and insights on how and when to incorporate AI tools in your software development process.
