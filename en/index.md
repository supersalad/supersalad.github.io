## 👋 Hi, my name is Andreas

I help teams grow and succeed through modern **DevOps** and **agile practices**. I believe that truly great systems are created in environments with **high trust**, **thoughtful system design**, and a culture of **continuous learning**, within the team as well as at the organizational level.

With solid experience in **software development**, **cloud**, and **system architecture**, I help companies make wise decisions about their technical direction. This can include:

* Leading **cloud transformations**
* Designing **scalable architectures**
* Coaching teams in **DevOps culture**

My focus is always on bridging the gap between **business goals** and **technical execution**.

I thrive where **innovation and efficiency** go hand in hand. By combining hands-on technical work with strategic advice, I help teams deliver high-quality solutions – quickly, clearly, and with a focus on what truly makes a difference.
