# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andreas Folkesson

I'm a passionate technology leader focused on empowering teams through modern **DevOps** and **Agile** practices. I believe great software is built in **high-trust environments**, with **well-designed systems**, and a culture of **continuous learning**â€”at both the team and organizational level.

With deep experience in **cloud strategy** and **software architecture**, I help companies make informed decisions about their technical direction. Whether it's:
- Guiding **cloud-native transformations**
- Designing **scalable architectures**
- Coaching teams in **DevOps culture**

â€¦I work to bridge the gap between **business goals** and **technical execution**.

I thrive where **innovation and efficiency** go hand in hand. My approach blends hands-on technical work with strategic advisingâ€”helping teams deliver high-quality software at speed, with clarity and alignment on what really matters.
